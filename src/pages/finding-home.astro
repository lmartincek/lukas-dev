            Home is not just a place; itâ€™s an experience.<br>
            In a map shown below are listed few places I visited throughout recent years.<br>
            Some of them visited as a tourist.<br>
            Some of them visited as digital nomad and spent quite a while working from there.<br>
            In our search for experience, I ended up finding myself in places, that I call now home.
