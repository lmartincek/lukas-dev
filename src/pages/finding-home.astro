        <p class="pt-4 text-sm">
            Home is not just a place; itâ€™s an experience.<br>
            It is about the ways that objects, places, and people are intertwined in the stories we tell ourselves.<br>
            In our search for home, we end up finding parts of ourselves, our memories, and our future.<br><br>
